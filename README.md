# sem-2-practical
## Write a C++ program that:Declares one global variableDeclares one local variable inside main()Dynamically allocates one integer using newPrint the addresses of all three and identify which memory region each belongs to.
## Write a function square(int) and call it:NormallyUsing a function pointer
## Write a program to print:Value of a variableAddress of the variableValue stored in the pointe
## Write a program where a pointer stores the address of another variable and copies its value into a third variable using dereferencing.
## What will be the output int x = 5; int *p = &x ,*p = 10;cout << x;
## int a = 1, b = 2;int *p = &a;p = &b;*p = 5;cout << a << " " << b;
## int x = 10;int *p = &x;int **pp = &p;**pp = 20;cout << x;
## int a[5] = {2,4,6,8,10};int *p = a;cout << *p++ << " ";cout << *p;
## Write a program to swap two numbers using pointers.
## Implement a simple dynamic integer variable that:Is created using newModified through a pointerProperly deleted
